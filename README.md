## About

This application was built using nextJS bootstrapped with create-next-app. This is my portfolio app piggy-backing off of an older implementation found in this repo: https://github.com/kebinghill/portfolio. It was built using Node, Express, Sequelize, Axios, HTML, CSS and React. I decided to try something new and took on the task of starting anew using nextjs and changing the deployment from Heroku to Vercel. I'm also a big fan of TailwindCSS which is what is utilized in this implementation of my portfolio as opposed to the older version which just used style sheets.

I've thoroughly enjoyed creating this app and hope you find it enjoyable as well!
